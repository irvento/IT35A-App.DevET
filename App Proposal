"How Much Is My Carbon Footprint?"

A web application that allows users to see their greenhouse gas or C0₂ contribution and suggest or feed users informations based on their inputs.


OBJECTIVE
    
    - It shall empower individuals and businesses to monitor, reduce, and offset carbon footprint.
    - It will provide tracking and showing carbon emissions based on user activities.
    - Offer actionable recommendations to encourage sustainable lifestyle choices.
    - Support global climate action (SDG 13) by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
    - Promote responsible consumption (SDG 12) through eco-conscious decision-making.


KEY SDGs TARGETED

    - SDG 13: Climate Action – Reduces greenhouse gas emissions by promoting sustainable habits.
    - SDG 12: Responsible Consumption & Production – Promotes environmentally friendly choices related to transportationn, energy, and consumption.
    - SDG 7: Affordable & Clean Energy – Facilitates the transition towards renewable forms of energy .
    - SDG 11: Sustainable Cities & Communities – Helps to make cities develop sustainably through smart choice of mobility and reducing energy consumption.


KEY FEATURES

    - Carbon Footprint Calculator
        Users enter daily activities (transport, food, energy, shopping) to calculate emissions.
    - Carbon Footprint Tracker
        Users can track their greenhouse gas emmision contribution.
    - Personalized Reduction Strategies
        Suggests lifestyle changes, such as using public transport, reducing meat consumption, or switching to renewable energy.(if possible i'll integrate AI, if i ccan??)
    - User Contribution Ranking 
        Users can see how much they contribute to carbon reduction.
    - Carbon Emission Awareness
        Educates users on the consequences of carbon emissions.

RESEARCH AND EVIDENCE
    - Causes and Effects of Climate Change according to United Nations(https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/causes-effects-climate-change)
        * According to it it says that "As greenhouse gas emissions blanket the Earth, they trap the sun’s heat. This leads to global warming 
        and climate change. The world is now warming faster than at any point in recorded history. Warmer temperatures over time are changing 
        weather patterns and disrupting the usual balance of nature. This poses many risks to human beings and all other forms of life on Earth."
    
    - Calculate Your Carbon Footprint(https://www.nature.org/en-us/get-involved/how-to-help/carbon-footprint-calculator/#:~:text=A%20carbon%20footprint%20is%20the,highest%20rates%20in%20the%20world.)
        * The United States has one of the greatest carbon footprints in the world, with an average of 16 tons per person. The average carbon footprint worldwide is more like 4 tons. By 2050, the average annual global carbon footprint must decrease to less than 2 tons in order to have the best chance of preventing a 2°C increase in global temperatures.

    - IPCC Reports on carbon emissions & climate change.      (https://www.ipcc.ch/2021/08/09/ar6-wg1-20210809-pr)
        * The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6, 2021) confirms that human activities have caused approximately 1.1°C of
         global warming since pre-industrial times, with climate change impacts becoming more frequent and severe. 
         Immediate, deep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are necessary to limit warming to 1.5°C and prevent catastrophic consequences.

    - Scientific papers on AI-powered sustainability tracking.(https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15)
        * The IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR15, 2018) highlights the critical importance of limiting global 
        temperature rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels to avoid severe climate impacts. Achieving this target requires rapid, 
        unprecedented transformations in energy, land use, and industry to reduce carbon emissions by about 45% by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2050.
