"How Much Is My Carbon Footprint?"

A web application that allows users to see their greenhouse gas or C0₂ contribution and suggest or feed users informations based on their inputs.


OBJECTIVE
    
    - It shall empower individuals and businesses to monitor, reduce, and offset carbon footprint.
    - It will provide tracking and showing carbon emissions based on user activities.
    - Offer actionable recommendations to encourage sustainable lifestyle choices.
    - Support global climate action (SDG 13) by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
    - Promote responsible consumption (SDG 12) through eco-conscious decision-making.


KEY SDGs TARGETED

    - SDG 13: Climate Action – Reduces greenhouse gas emissions by promoting sustainable habits.
    - SDG 12: Responsible Consumption & Production – Promotes environmentally friendly choices related to transportationn, energy, and consumption.
    - SDG 11: Sustainable Cities & Communities – Helps to make cities develop sustainably through smart choice of mobility and reducing energy consumption.


KEY FEATURES

    - Carbon Footprint Calculator
        Users enter daily activities (transport, food, energy, shopping) to calculate emissions.
    - Carbon Footprint Tracker
        Users can track their greenhouse gas emmision contribution.
    - Personalized Reduction Strategies
        Suggests lifestyle changes, such as using public transport, reducing meat consumption, or switching to renewable energy.(if possible i'll integrate AI, if i ccan??)
    - User Contribution Ranking 
        Users can see how much they contribute to carbon reduction.
    - Carbon Emission Awareness
        Educates users on the consequences of carbon emissions.

RESEARCH AND EVIDENCE
    - United Nations' Causes and Effects of Climate Change (https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/causes-effects-climate-change)
        * According to it "As greenhouse gas emissions covers the Earth, they trap the sun's heat as if it hold the heat from the sun. This leads to global warming
        and climate change. Longer and hotter periods over time are altering the patterns of weather and nature to their usual balance."

        * According to the website it states that:
           " The United States is one of the biggest contributors to carbon emmision, all over the world, each individual has average contribution of 4 tons, and to avoid a temperature increase by 2°C the average global must drop down progressively to below 2 tons by 2050."
    - IPCC Reports on carbon emissions & climate change.(https://www.ipcc.ch/2021/08/09/ar6-wg1-20210809-pr)
        * According to the IPCC's Sixth Assesment Report, human-induced carbon emissions have led to a 1.1°C increase in global temperature, and immediate reductions in greenhouse gas emissionss are important to limit warming to 1.5°C and prevent catastrophic and disasstrous  outcomes.

        * Limit global warming, that is the objective, according to the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C SR15, 2018, and to ensure that temperatures can rise by a further 1.5C above preindustrial levels and avoid serious climate effects, in which case much faster
        historic changes in industry, land use, and energy to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and cut carbon emissions by around 45% by 2030.
