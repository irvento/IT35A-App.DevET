Goals
The purpose of this literature review is to perform a literature review to assess and compare web services and XML integration. The paper will be on understanding their benefits, best practices, and real-world applications. 
This involves understanding how each approach contributes to system integration, interoperability, and efficiency in modern software development.

Roles
    As researchers, my role is to analyze and synthesize existing studies, journal articles, and technical documentation. This includes:
        • Review of scholarly and industry sources on web services and XML integration.
        • Identification of strengths, weaknesses, and best practices of each approach.
        • Real-world applications and industry adoption.
        • Structured comparison based on empirical evidence and expert opinions.

Audience
    The primary audience includes:
        • Instructors – To evaluate our understanding of technical concepts and research methodology.
        • Software development professionals – To seek insights on best practices for system integration.
        • System integration specialists – Want to know which approach between web services or XML-based integration is better for them.

Scenario
    Students need to work independently on:
        Identify credible sources (peer-reviewed papers, industry whitepapers, case studies).
        Compare effectiveness, efficiency, security, and scalability of web services and XML integration.
        Analyze best implementation practices.
        Support recommendations with valid research evidence.
